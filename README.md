# Welcome to Redis Caching

This branch is the starting point for playing with Redis caching.

There are exercises for the following topics:
- Caching with Redis. See the README-redis-caching.md file for the exercises.
- JPA 2nd level caching with Redis. See the README-jpa-2nd-level-caching.md file for the exercises.

You can safely use this project as a starting point for both topics since they will not interfere with each other.
